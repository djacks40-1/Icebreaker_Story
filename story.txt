In the town of Raesfeld, a boy was crying while eating his bratwurst.
Then he got into his BMW and crashed into a Porsche.
His klimaanlage unit leaked and the brot became soggy.
The boy went to the Berlin Flughafen.
He flew to a biergarten to drink and eat apfelkuchen.
While there, he joined a apfelkuchen eating contest, but he unfortunately lost to a wettbewerbsfaehig hund.
